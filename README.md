**Note**: The website uses fetch to load data and it is recommended that you use a live server to avoid ruing into CORS issues. Http-server is a good option.

1. Install it globally with `npm instatll --g -http-server`
2. Start the server in the projects folder `http-server . -p 8000`
3. Then open browser at `http://localhost:8000`
